			<h3> History of La Signora :</h3>
			<p>La Signora is an old member of the Fatui that rules the land of Snezhnaya and serves the Tsaritsa of Snezhnaya with the best of her abilities. She makes her first appearance at the end of Act 3 of the Prologue when she was sent by her master to steal Venti's Gnosis.</p><p>

After the Venti and the Traveler walk away from the Mondstadt Cathedral, La Signora accompained by her agents and mages strike the group by surprise, quickly apprehending them and taunting Venti who was too weak to be considered a "god" by Mondstadt country. While she easily defeated Venti, her agents hold back the Traveler allowing her to easily pull out Venti's Gnosis for her master. She then decides to leave before the Knights of Favonius can spot her and recognize her as a member of the malicious Fatui, knocking out both Traveler and Venti.</p><p>

Weeks later, Zhongli (also known as the mortal form of Rex Lapis the Geo Archon of Liyue) was approached by Signora under the influence of Tsaritsa once said deity decided to "retire" from his duty as the guardian of Liyue and leave the land to be taken care of by the mortals. Both Signora and Zhongli formed "a contract to end all contracts" and both used Tartaglia and his Fatui division as their pawn and form an incident that would shake Liyue to the core by faking the death of their Archon. Rex is purportedly "assassinated" during the titular Rite, and his vessel - known as the Exuvia - was taken away to the Golden House by the Liyue Qixing to hide the body from potential threats like the Fatui that were the first to receive the blame. When the battle was over with the defeat of Fatui and the ancient god unleashed by Childe to destroy Liyue and lure the Geo Archon to him, Signora revealed her plan to Childe and the Traveler at the Northland Bank as Zhongli handed his own Geo Gnosis to Signora. From that point on, Childe's disdain for Signora only got worse to the point he refused to share the same boat with Signora when returning back to Snezhnaya.</p><p>

In Inazuma, the Traveler discovers that Signora (and Kujou Takayuki) were behind the Fatui's involvement in the Vision Hunt Decree and their plan to distribute Delusions to the members of the Watatsumi Army. At the Tenshukaku, they discover the Raiden Shogun against Signora, angered by her punishing Kujou Sara. The Traveler takes to the Raiden Shogun's side, to which Signora reminds them that they are still a wanted criminal. They decide to call a duel before the throne of Inazuma, which Signora and the Raiden Shogun accept. Signora chooses to battle the Traveler due to her hatred of them, and transforms into her true identity as the Crimson Witch of Flame. Despite her powerful magic, the Traveler bests Signora, much to her shock. The Raiden Shogun then arrives and strikes Signora down with the Musou no Hitotachi, with Signora telling the Shogun if she kills her, the entire Fatui will come and destroy Inazuma until Signora calling her, the Traveler and Paimon "filthy rats" before disintegrating into ashes. The Traveler then takes the Funerary Mask (Signora's crown) as a trophy.</p><p>

After her death, the Fatui retrieved her body and the remaining Fatui Harbingers arranged her burial inside their base of operations, the Zapolyarny Palace. The Fatui's working time had been halted for half a day in mourning of her passing.</p>
